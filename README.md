# Horoscope Notifier in Python

This Python script fetches daily horoscope information and sends notifications. It utilizes the requests library to fetch horoscope data from the aztro API and the plyer library for cross-platform notifications.

## Usage
- Replace `YOUR_SIGN` in the script with your desired zodiac sign (e.g., 'aries', 'taurus', etc.).

`python horoscope_notifier.py`

# Note
 - The script uses the aztro API for horoscope data.
 - Notifications are handled using the plyer library. Test notifications on your specific operating system.
 - Horoscope data availability may vary; explore different APIs based on your preferences.
# Additional Steps
 - Schedule the script to run daily using tools like Task Scheduler (Windows) or cron jobs (Linux/macOS).
 - Customize the script to fetch and notify horoscopes for multiple signs or add more features as needed.
 - Important: Respect API usage policies, and ensure your script complies with any applicable terms of use or licenses.
